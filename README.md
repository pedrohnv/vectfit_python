Duplication of the [Fast Relaxed Vector-Fitting algorithm](http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/VECTFIT/) in python.

This version was inspired by the one made by Phil Reinhold. I borrowed some of the changes made by Alexis Morvan (https://github.com/AlMrvn/vectfit_python).

The error of the fitting is too big when compared to the original MATLAB version. Probably the Least-Square system is being built wrongly. Also, relaxed version not implemented.

There is also a Julia version. Check it out: https://github.com/pedrohnv/vectfit_julia

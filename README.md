Duplication of the [Fast Relaxed Vector-Fitting algorithm](http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/VECTFIT/) in python.

This version was inspired by the one made by Phil Reinhold. The changes are mainly of documentation and code organization. There is no auto rescaling of the problem!

I borrowed some of the changes made by Alexis Morvan (https://github.com/AlMrvn/vectfit_python).
